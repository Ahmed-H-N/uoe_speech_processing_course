There is a vast literature in signal processing about designing filters to transform one signal into another. In speech processing, our signals often includes some sort of noise that we'd like to get rid of.  However, we can also use filters to shape a simple input, like an impulse train, into something much more complicated, like a speech waveform. \n",

    "On a more general note, this sort of convolution with a (short) window is how we do frequency analysis of speech: we taking windows of speech (aka frames) through time and and apply the DFT to get a frequency response.  A rectangular window is the simplest type of window we can take.  The equation above tells us that the sinc shaped response is an inherent part of using this sort of window.  In fact, we can use other window types (e.g. Hanning) to make the main lobes shaper and the sidelobes flatter, but we never really get away from this sinc shape in real world applications.  This is a key component of this soft of <strong>short term analysis</strong>.  \n",
