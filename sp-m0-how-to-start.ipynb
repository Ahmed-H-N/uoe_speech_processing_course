This will contain notebooks with  materials you should go through before meeting with your tutor.  Some of them will have an interactive component that you can run directly in the notebook (i.e. [signals](./signals)), but most will require you to use some external tools (e.g. Praat for [phon](./phon), Festival for TTS, HTK for ASR). \n"

    "\n",
    "University of Edinburgh students have access to [Edina Noteable](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable): the university's online Jupyter Notebook server. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to use Jupyter Notebooks, Python and all the extra packages we need through your browser (you don't need to install anything on your side).  \n",

    "\n",
    "How to get these notebooks on Noteable: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Start up Noteable by going to the following URL in your browser login in with your EASE username and password:\n",
    "  * https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login\n",
    " \n",
    "* Select Standard Notebook (if you're given an option) and click on the start button\n",
    "\n",
    "* You'll then see the jupyter start directory, showing you links to the files in it (probably empty at this point). \n",

    "This isn't really necessary for our class work, but it may be useful thing for you to get familiar with in the future.

Once you've got the hang of it, it can also be a lot easier to use the terminal to do a lot of things, e.g. organize your files using shell commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also run Jupyter Notebooks locally on your own computer. Once you have everything installed, you should be able to go through all the lab materials offline. To do this, you'll need to have a few things installed: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3.x\n",
    "* Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* numpy\n",
    "* matplotlib\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Install Python 3.8 and Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Miniconda 3.8 installer. You'll need to choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Window, MacOs or Linux) and the number of bits your CPU uses (64 or 32).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "* https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic instructions for installing miniconda on the unix shell:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've downloaded the installer, open up a terminal and go to the directory you installed it into (probably `Downloads`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to check the downloaded file isn't corrupted.  You can check that the string it returns matches SHA256 hash listed next to the download link you used. \n",
    "```\n",
    "sha256sum ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the permissions on the Miniconda installer so you can run it ('u' for user, 'x' for execute): \n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod u+x ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then run the installer script: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "The installer will ask you a bunch of questions (agree to the license etc) which you basically have to say yes to if you want to use Miniconda.  You can also choose where it installs Miniconda, but usually the default location (in your home directory) is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Create a conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then need to close and reopen your terminal.  Now run the following command to create a new Python 3 environment called `slp` (actually you can call it whatever you want!). \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n slp python=3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, activate the environment. \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate slp\n",
    "```\n",
    "Doing this basically means that you're telling the shell to use this version of python instead of the default version of python on your computer (For example, on Guacamole the default version of python is 2.7, which is a version of python no longer being maintained).  Activating the environment also means you can download python packages in a systematic way and you (probably) won't run into permission problems on computers where you don't have administrator access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's good practice you use python enviroments for your projects so that you can keep track of dependencies.  New updates to python packages can sometimes mess up how old code works, so if you want someone else to run your code, having a specific conda environment means someone  else (maybe even your future self?) can easily recreate the conditions in which your code was created on a different machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Jupyter Notebooks and other dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need can use conda to install a bunch of stuff, i.e. jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge  notebook numpy matplotlib ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can finally startup jupyter notebooks! Note you need to be in the slp environment we just created for this to work (i.e. run `conda activate slp` before this). \n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command starts a local notebook server and will give you a link to it. Open that link in your browser and you're all set!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You'll need to get the notebook repository from gitlab the 'normal way'.  Go to the directory you want to download the notebooks into and run the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/laic/uoe_speech_processing_course\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should now see a directory call `uoe_speech_processing_course` in the directory where you called the `git clone` command. \n",

    "You can also potentially use a [github desktop user interface](https://desktop.github.com) to clone the repository. \n",
