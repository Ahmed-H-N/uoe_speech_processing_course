    "\n",
    "People taking the Speech Processing course come from lots of different backgrounds. While we assume everybody has a bit of programming experience, we've tried to design these labs so that you don't actually need to write code to work through them. Hopefully the code blocks have enough comments that you'll be able to follow even if you don't have much coding experience. Mostly you'll just need to change some variables here and there to do the exercises.  But, of course, you're welcome to play with the code to explore the topics we cover and to write your own code! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Jupyter Notebooks \n",
    "\n",
    "These labs use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). These provide an interactive way to run python code and write nicely formatted text using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tutorials about using Jupyter Notebooks on the internet.  If you've never used them before, it's a good idea to go through at least one to get used to how they work. Here's just a sample: \n",

    "### 1.2 NumPy and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "NumPy is _the_ python package for doing scientific computing.  That is, if you want to write programs that use vectors and matrices, you'll be using NumPy. It includes lots of efficient methods for calculating various types of functions (e.g. trig functions like sin, cos, exp) and applying them to variable sized vectors and matrices.  If you're used to using R or Matlab, you'll probably find it very familiar. If you go on to do more machine learning you'll definitely use NumPy (or packages based on it) a lot, so it's well worth getting to know.  But for this course, knowing the basics just make the code blocks a little more interpretable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive python visualization package that works well with NumPy. It is vast and complicated and we will not use that much of it's capabilities in these notebooks.  But again, you'll likely see this used in examples of plotting graphs with python in many speech processing related code bases. So, being able to recognize it's basic syntax will be helpful, but you definitely don't need to know much about this to use these notebooks.  \n",

    "\n",
    "If you have a decent internet connection, the easiest way to start using jupyter notebooks is to use the University of Edinburgh's Noteable service.  This allows you to use Jupyter Notebooks, Python and all the extra packages we need through your browser (you don't need to install anything on your side).  \n",

    "\n",
    "* You'll then see the jupyter start directory, showing you links to the files in it (probably empty at this point). \n",

    "    * https://github.com/laic/uoe_speech_processing_course\n",

    "git clone https://github.com/laic/uoe_speech_processing_course\n",
    "```\n",

For example, you'll need to use the terminal if you want to clone a private git repository. Once you've got the hang of it, tt can also be a lot easier to use the terminal to do a lot of things, e.g. organize your files.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also run Jupyter Notebooks locally on your own computer. Once you have everything installed, you should be able to go through all the lab materials offline. To do this, you'll need to have a few things installed: \n",

    "#### Install Python 3.8 and Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Miniconda 3.8 installer. You'll need to choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Window, MacOs or Linux) and the number of bits your CPU uses (64 or 32).  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've downloaded the installer, open up a terminal and go to the directory you installed it into (probably `Downloads`).  \n",

    "The installer will ask you a bunch of questions (agree to the license etc) which you basically have to say yes to if you want to use Miniconda.  You can also choose where it installs Miniconda, but usually the default location (in your home directory) is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then need to close and reopen your terminal.  Now run the following command to create a new Python 3 environment called `slp` (actually you can call it whatever you want!). \n",

Activating the environment also means you can download python packages in a systematic way and you (probably) won't run into permission problems on computers where you don't have administrator access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's good practice you use python enviroments for your projects so that you can keep track of dependencies.  New updates to python packages can sometimes mess up how old code works, so if you want someone else to run your code, having a specific conda environment means someone  else (maybe even your future self?) can easily recreate the conditions in which your code was created on a different machine. \n",

This means that variables are updated in the order that you run the cells, not necessarily the order they appear on the page!  \n",
